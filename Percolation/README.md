# Percolation and the Weighted Quick Union Find algorithm

The problem originated from the first assignement of the coursera course entitled 'Algorithms, Part 1' delivered by
Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne via Princeton. The full problem description is given in 
http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html  . The original problem was solved by using Java,
with the complete availablity of a library constructed for the purpose of this course. In this folder, the project is performed
using c++. Elements of this problem can be found in section 1.3 of 'Algorithms in c++, parts 1-4' by Robert Sedgewick.

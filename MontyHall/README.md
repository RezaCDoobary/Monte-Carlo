# The Monty Hall problem

The Monty Hall problem is given as follows. You are a contestant on a game show, with a three doors, two goats a winning car
and the game show host. The idea of the game is to simple guess the correct door and win yourself a fabolous new car. 

The Monty Hall problem, specifically works as follows: at the beginning of the game you select a door, lets say door number 1,
to which the host shows you that door number 3 is in fact a goat. The host then turns to you and asks you if you want to change
your mind and go for number 2. The answer is in fact to change your mind, is it is probablistically favourable to win if you
choose number 2, as its probability of being the car winning door has just gone from 1/3 to 2/3. 

This is an interesting problem to apply the Monte Carlo mechanism to this.
